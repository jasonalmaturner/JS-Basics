//Write a function called adder that uses the 'arguments' keyword that comes with every function to
//loop over all the arguments the function received, add them all together, then return the result.
//Save the result of the return value from your adder function, then alert "The Total Number was " + the number that was
//returned from adder.

function adder(){
  var total = 0;
  for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
